## Overview

This design enables:
- **Scalable** and **fault-tolerant** message routing via Kafka.
- **Low-latency** message delivery for connected users.
- **Eventual delivery** to offline users via APN/FCM push notifications.
- **Real-time synchronization** of message states (`RECEIVED`, `DELIVERED`, `READ`).
- **Idempotent and self-healing** operations across distributed replicas.

---

## Message Routing Layer

### Kafka as Backbone
All inter-replica message routing uses **Kafka** for durability, ordering, and reliability.

### Topics
To avoid topic explosion, we define a limited set of high-throughput topics:

| Topic | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| `user-inbox` | Direct user-to-user messages |
| `group-inbox` | Group messages |
| `delivery-receipts` | Internal system topic for ACK and receipt updates |
| `user-notifications` | Notifications to senders about delivery/read updates |

---

## Partitioning & Scaling Strategy

### Sticky Partition Mapping
- Each `user_id` or `group_id` is mapped to a **sticky partition** via **consistent hashing**.
- Ensures all messages for a given recipient are ordered and routed to the same partition.

### Consumer Subscription
- Each **app replica** dynamically subscribes only to partitions corresponding to connected users.
- Reduces unnecessary load and cross-replica traffic.

### Hot Partition Mitigation
- Implement **consistent hashing with virtual nodes (vnodes)**.  
  Example: 1000 partitions with 10–50 virtual nodes for even load distribution.

---

## Horizontal Scaling

### Adding or Removing Replicas
- Adding replicas → create new partitions and redistribute users via consistent hashing.
- Removing replicas → reassign affected partitions.

### Switchover Procedure
1. When topology changes:
   - Replica records a **highWaterMark offset** for current partitions.
   - Continues consuming until offsets reach the highWaterMark.
2. In parallel:
   - Starts consuming from new assigned partitions.
3. Producers maintain a **1-minute grace period**, during which messages are sent to both old and new partitions.

✅ This ensures **zero data loss** and **no message duplication**.

---

## Message Synchronization (Offline & Reconnect Flow)

### When User Disconnects
- Replica continues consuming the user’s partition if other users share it.
- Messages for disconnected users trigger **secondary channel delivery** (see [Push Notifications](#second-channel-delivery-push-notifications)).

### When User Reconnects
Client performs a **sync-up with ScyllaDB**:
1. Fetch latest N messages (e.g., 50).
2. For each message:
   - If already cached → send `"READ"` ACK if newly read.
   - If missing → send `"DELIVERED"` or `"READ"` depending on visibility.
   - Mixed cases → send batch ACKs.

Replica updates delivery states and reconciles them in ScyllaDB.

---

## Message Receipts

### Delivery Pipeline
Receipts are produced to the `delivery-receipts` topic with statuses:

| Status | Trigger |
|---------|----------|
| `RECEIVED` | Replica stored message in ScyllaDB and produced to Kafka |
| `DELIVERED` | Message successfully sent via WebSocket and ACKed by client |
| `READ` | User explicitly read message (via WebSocket or API) |

### Offline Behavior
- Offline users → only `RECEIVED` status recorded initially.
- Upon reconnection, `"DELIVERED"` and `"READ"` statuses are reconciled.

### ScyllaDB Tables

#### `message-receipts`
| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `chat_id`, `message_id`, `user_id` | Primary keys |
| `status` | `"RECEIVED"`, `"DELIVERED"`, `"READ"` |
| `channel` | `"ws"`, `"apn"`, etc. |
| `updated_at` | Timestamp |
| TTL | 7 days |

#### `chat-read-pointers`
| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `chat_id`, `user_id` | Primary keys |
| `last_read_message_id` | Latest fully read message |
| `updated_at` | Timestamp |

### Reconciliation Logic
- Update status only when new state > current state (RECEIVED < DELIVERED < READ).
- Updating to `"READ"` also updates `chat-read-pointers`.
- When a message receipt changes, a notification is published to Kafka topic `user-notifications`.

### Sender Notification
- Sender’s replica consumes `user-notifications` and pushes updates via WebSocket.
- Offline senders receive updates on next sync.

---

## Second Channel Delivery (Push Notifications)

When WebSocket delivery fails, a **secondary delivery channel** (APN/FCM) ensures message delivery.

### `push-notifications` Table (ScyllaDB)

| Column | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `text` | `{type}#{user_id}#{notification_id/message_id}` |
| `deliver_at` | `timestamp` | Scheduled delivery time; `NULL` = delivered |
| `state` | `text` | `"PENDING"` / `"DELIVERED"` |
| `payload` | `json` | Notification content |
| `created_at` | `timestamp` | Record creation time |
| TTL | ~7 days |

---

### Replica Write Rules

#### On WebSocket Failure
```sql
INSERT INTO push_notifications (...) VALUES (...) IF NOT EXISTS;
```
- `deliver_at = now() + 15s` (configurable)
- If Presence Service reports user as online → delay = `now() + 30s`

#### On WebSocket Success
```sql
UPDATE push_notifications 
SET deliver_at = NULL, state = 'DELIVERED'
WHERE id = ... 
IF state = 'PENDING';
```

#### Conflict Handling

| Existing | New | Action |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| `PENDING` + failed | Do nothing |
| `PENDING` + success | Overwrite → mark delivered |
| `DELIVERED` + any | Do nothing |

---

### Background Worker

A worker service periodically scans `push-notifications` and delivers pending notifications.

**Loop (every ~5s):**
1. Query pending rows:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM push_notifications
   WHERE deliver_at <= now()
     AND state = 'PENDING';
   ```
2. Group notifications by `user_id` / chat to avoid notification spam.
3. Retrieve APN/FCM tokens.
4. Send notifications.
5. On successful delivery or invalid token:
   ```sql
   UPDATE push_notifications
   SET deliver_at = NULL, state = 'DELIVERED'
   WHERE id = ... IF state = 'PENDING';
   ```
6. Update `message-receipts` to `status='DELIVERED'`, `channel='apn'`.

All rows expire automatically after TTL.

---

## Presence Service Caveats

- Presence data may **lag** (e.g., due to replica crash or network delay).
- Never fully rely on Presence Service to suppress push notifications.
- Safer approach:
  - Always enqueue a push-notification record after WebSocket failure.
  - If user is "online" → delay notification slightly (e.g., 30s).
  - If still undelivered → send push anyway.

✅ Guarantees **eventual delivery** despite transient inconsistencies.

---

## Reliability & Cleanup

- **TTL expiration (~7 days)** for automatic cleanup across all tables:
  - `message-receipts`
  - `chat-read-pointers`
  - `push-notifications`
- **Grace period (1 min)** for Kafka producers during scaling ensures message continuity.
- **Idempotent updates (CAS in ScyllaDB)** prevent duplicates.
- **Tombstone markers** in `push-notifications` prevent redundant push notifications.
